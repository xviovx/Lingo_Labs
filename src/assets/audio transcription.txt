 First, the spaceship's rockets lifted off the ground and pushed it upward, vertically. This takes it away from the Earth and eventually into space. When the ship reaches space, it turns to become horizontal. Then its rockets push it until it reaches a very high speed. The ship's rockets then stop. Now, if the ship was still in the Earth's atmosphere, it would slow down as it flew through the air, due to air resistance. But because there's no air in space, the ship doesn't slow down when its rockets stop. It keeps moving forward at the same speed. Most people think that above the Earth, in space, there's no gravity. They think that's why astronauts are weightless. But that's not true. The Earth's gravity continues to pull the spaceship and the astronauts downward. However, because the ship is moving so fast as it falls, it doesn't move toward the Earth. Instead, it travels around the Earth. So when a spaceship and its crew are in orbit and weightless, they're actually constantly falling and gravity is still pulling them.
